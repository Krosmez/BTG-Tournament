# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Before you start the project for the first time, don't forget to use `npm install` üòâ

## Some useful tips

‚ö†Ô∏è `main` branch isn't for development, you can create a new branch to work on ‚ö†Ô∏è<br/><br/>
Try to work on one feature at a time. <br/><br/>
Commit only for the feature you're working on. <br/><br/>
On this project i'll try to create a branch for specific feature, example : <br/>
I want to create a Heading Component so my branch would be `feature/heading-component`<br/>
Whenever my work is done I create a Pull request and wait for approval üòÅ <br/><br/>
Also i'll try to stick to this commit pattern : <br/>
< [KEYWORD] what i have done > <br/>
Keywords are just here to know very quickly what this commit is about some basic keyword are going to be :

- ADD
- REWORK
- UPDATE
- FIX
- DELETE
